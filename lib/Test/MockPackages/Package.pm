=head1 NAME

Test::MockPackages::Package - Helper package for mocking subroutines and methods on a given package.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $m = Test::MockPackages::Package->new('ACME::Widget');
   ->mock( 'do_thing' )
   ->expects( $arg1, $arg2 )
   ->returns( $retval );

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new( )

Instantiates and returns a new Test::MockPackages::Package object.

Both this package, and L<Test::MockPackages> are light-weight packages intended to maintain scope of your mocked subroutines and methods. The bulk of your mocking will take place on L<Test::MockPackages::Mock> objects. See that package for more information.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 mock( Str $name ) : Test::MockPackages::Mock

Instantiates a new L<Test::MockPackages::Mock> object using for subroutine or method named C<$name>. Repeated calls to this method with the same C<$name> will return the same object.

Return value: A L<Test::MockPackages::Mock> object.
